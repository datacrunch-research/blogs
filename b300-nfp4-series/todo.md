### TODO List
* [ ] Add figures to the intro post
* [ ] Try to follow the same narrative of the slides aka give a historical perspective:
    FP32 -> FP16 -> BF16 -> FP8 -> MX formats -> NVFP4
* [ ] Look for more details on the Random Hadamarmd Transform (so far I didn't put much emphasis on that)
* [ ] Add some detail/plot on the Stochastic Rounding
* [ ] Ask if we can reuse the figures from NVIDIA or we need to redo them
